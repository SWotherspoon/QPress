\title{Response to Press Perturbation}
\usage{
press.impact(edges, perturb, monitor = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{an edge list.}

\item{perturb}{a named vector that indicates which nodes were
perturbed and the relative magnitude of the perturbation.}

\item{monitor}{n named vector that indicates the subset of nodes
to monitor.}
}
\value{
Returns a function that when applied to a community matrix
calculates the response to a press perturbation.
}
\description{
Construct a function to calculate response to perturbation.
}
\details{
Given the an edge list that specifies a directed graph, a set of
nodes to perturb and a set of nodes to monitor,
\code{press.impact} constructs a function of a single argument
\code{W} that determines the response of the monitored nodes to
the perturbation for a simulated community matrix \code{W}.
