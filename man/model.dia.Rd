\usage{
model.dia(file, labels = NULL)

write.dia(edges, file, width = 8, height = 2, self = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{name of the file to read or write}

\item{labels}{the sequence of labels to use for the nodes}

\item{edges}{an edge list}

\item{width}{width of the nodes in Dia}

\item{height}{height of the nodes in Dia}

\item{self}{should self edges be written.}
}
\value{
The \code{model.dia} function returns an edge list.
}
\description{
Read and write Dia representations of models
}
\details{
These functions read and write Dia representions of model
toplogies.

These functions should be used with care as no attempt is made to
test for model mis-specification.  The \code{model.dia} function
only recognizes node shapes "Flowchart - Ellipse", "Flowchart - Box"
and "Flowchart - Terminal", line types "Standard - Arc",
"Standard - ZigZagLine" and "Standard - Line", and arrow types 8,
1 and 5.  Other node shapes, line or arrow types will be silently
ignored leading to a mispecified model.
