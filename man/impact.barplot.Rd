\title{Impact Barplot}
\usage{
impact.barplot(sim, epsilon = 1e-05, main = "", cex.axis = 1)

impact.barplot0(
  sim,
  perturb = 0,
  monitor = NA,
  epsilon = 1e-05,
  main = "",
  cex.axis = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{the result from \code{system.simulate}}

\item{epsilon}{outomes below this in absolute magnitude are treated as zero.}

\item{main}{text for plot title}

\item{cex.axis}{character expansion factor for the edge labels}

\item{perturb}{a named vector that indicates which nodes were
perturbed and the relative magnitude of the perturbation.}

\item{monitor}{n named vector of signs (-1,0,1) or NA that indicates the outcome of the perturbation.}
}
\description{
Display the impact of a perturbation as a barplot
}
\details{
This control constructs a barplot that shows the fraction of
simulations in which a positive (orange), negative (blue) or zero
(off white) outcome occurs at each node following a given
perturbation.

The user may specify the perturbation of the nodes, and any
outcome known from monitoring the network, and then construct a
barplot of the frequency table of outcomes at each node.

\code{impact.barplot0} is a non-interactive variant for
programmatic use.
