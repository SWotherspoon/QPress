\title{Validation Criterion}
\usage{
press.validate(edges, perturb, monitor, epsilon = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{an edge list}

\item{perturb}{a named vector that indicates which nodes were
perturbed and the relative magnitude of the perturbation.}

\item{monitor}{n named vector of signs (-1,0,1) that indicates the outcome of the perturbation.}

\item{epsilon}{outomes below this in absolute magnitude are treated as zero.}
}
\value{
Returns a function that when applied to a community matrix
determines whether the matrix is consistent with the given
validation criterion.
}
\description{
Construct a function to test a validation criterion
}
\details{
Given the an edge list that specifies a directed graph, a set of
nodes to perturb and a set of nodes to monitor,
\code{press.validate} constructs a function of a single argument
\code{W} to test whether the response to perturbation of the
system represented by the community matrix \code{W} matches
an observed outcome.  The outcome is only specified up to sign (-1,
0 or +1), where outcomes smaller than \code{epsilon} are treated
as zero.

\examples{
set.seed(32)
## Sample model
edges <- parse.text(c(
  "E *-> D",
  "D *-> C",
  "C -> E",
  "E *-> B",
  "B *-> A",
  "A -> E",
  "D --> B"))
edges <- enforce.limitation(edges)
s <- community.sampler(edges)
s$select(0.5)
## Perturb D, B and C must decrease
f <- press.validate(edges,perturb=c(D=1),monitor=c(B=-1,C=-1))
W <- s$community()
f(W)
W <- s$community()
f(W)
