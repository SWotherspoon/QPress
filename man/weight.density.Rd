\usage{
weight.density(sim, epsilon = 1e-05, main = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{the result from \code{system.simulate}}

\item{epsilon}{outomes below this in absolute magnitude are treated as zero.}

\item{main}{text for plot title}
}
\description{
Display weights of valid and invalid matrices as a density plots
}
\details{
This control constructs density plots that show the distribution
of selected edge weights for the cases that meet the selected
validation criteria (blue), and those that do not (red), following
a given perturbation.

The slider controls the level of smoothing of the densities.
Edges are labelled by pairs of integers for compactness, where the
integer codes correspond to the ordering of the node labels.
