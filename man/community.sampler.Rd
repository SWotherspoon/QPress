Returns a list with elements
\item{\code{community()}}{a function to generate a random community matrix}
\item{\code{select(p)}}{a function that randomly selects which uncertain edges will be retained}

\description{
Construct functions to generate random community matrices
}
\details{
Given an edge list that specifies a directed graph, this function
constructs a list of functions that can be use to generate random
community matrices corresponding to that directed graph.

Edges in the edge list that do not fall in a required group are
considered uncertain, and may or may not be represented in the
community matrix.

Random community matrices are generated in two stages, the first
stage determines which of the uncertain edges will be included or
excluded in subsequent simulations, while the second stage
generates random matrices corresponding to the selected.  The
\code{select} function is a function of a single argument \code{p}
that determines which of the uncertain edge pairs will be included
in matrices generated by subsequent calls to
\code{community}. This function always selects either neither or
both edges of a pair and every uncertain pair has likelihood
\code{p} of being selected. The \code{community} function is a
function of no arguments that generates a random community matrix.
The \code{weights} function is a function of a single argument
\code{W} that returns those entries of the community matrix
\code{W} that correspond to edges in the edge list.

## Sample model
edges <- parse.text(c(
  "E *-> D",
  "D *-> C",
  "C -> E",
  "E *-> B",
  "B *-> A",
  "A -> E",
  "D --> B"))
edges <- enforce.limitation(edges)
s <- community.sampler(edges)
## Force D --> B edge out
s$select(0)
## Generate community matrices
s$community()
s$community()
## Force D --> B edge in
s$select(1)
## Generate community matrices
s$community()
s$community()
## Select the uncertain D --> B edge with prob 0.6
s$select(0.6)
## Generate community matrices
s$community()
