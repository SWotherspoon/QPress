\title{Qualitative Network Analysis}
\description{
Qualitiative analysis of press perturbations of network models.
Given a network model represented as a signed directed graphs, this
package provide facilities for evaluating the impact of a press
perturbation to the system through simulation.

This package provides facilities for simulating press
perturbation scenarios for qualitative network models
specified as signed directed graphs (signed digraphs).
