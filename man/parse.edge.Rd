\title{Indices of (Directed) Edges}
\usage{
parse.edge(lines, edges)
}
\arguments{
\item{lines}{a vector of strings representing directed edges}

\item{edges}{an edge list}
}
\value{
the indices of the directed edges within the edge list
}
\description{
Parse a text representation of (directed) edges, return the index of the
directed edge within the edge list.
}
\details{
Each directed edge is represented as a string consisting of two node labels
separated by an arrow, where the arrow consists of a sequence of dashes "-"
followed by one of the character sequences ">","*","<>". The number of
dashes used in the arrow is ignored.
}
\examples{
## Sample model
edges <- parse.digraph(c(
  "E *-> D",
  "D *-> C",
  "C -> E",
  "E *-> B",
  "B *-> A",
  "A -> E",
  "D --> B"))
edges <- enforce.limitation(edges)
parse.edge(c("E->D","D-*E","A-*B"),edges)
}
